Vivado is a software developed for AMD Xilinx. It is used to program FPGAs.If you want to design some prototype , then first you will write the HDL of it. Then vivado will change those HDLs in synthesised netlist, before that there are many more steps and bit Stream is the final step in which we send data in FPGA board.I'll be listing few examples, the board used is Zedboard ZynqÂ®-7000 SoC and Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 .
